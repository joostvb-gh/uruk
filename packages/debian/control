Description: Wrapper for Linux iptables, for filtering rules management
 Uruk is a wrapper for Linux iptables.  A very simple shell script, but useful
 if you need similar (but not the same) packet filtering configurations on lots
 of boxes.  It uses a template file, which gets source-d as a shell script, to
 get lists of source addresses, allowed to use specific network services.
 Listing these groups of allowed hosts and allowed services is all what's
 needed to configure your box.
 .
 Main difference with other firewall setup tools: uruk is just a very small
 shell script, supports only iptables (yet), no gui, no interactive setup, no
 default configuration (yet).  You'll like this if you'd rather not have lots
 of (probably buggy) code between you and your filtering rules.
