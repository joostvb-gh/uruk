\NAME{uruk-save}{save uruk rc configuration in iptables-save-style format}

\sec{synopsis}{SYNOPSIS}
  \par
  \uruk_save
   \synoptopt{-6}{save ip6tables rules}

\sec{options}{OPTIONS}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\defopt{-6}{save ip6tables rules}} Don't save iptables rules but save
ip6tables rules, for IPv6 filtering.

\end{itemize}

\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\uruk_save saves the IPv4 rules in \ttrcpath in \bf{iptables-save(5)}-style
format, without invoking \bf{iptables(8)}.  If the \bf{-6} option is given, the
IPv6 rules (if any) in \ttrcpath are saved, in \bf{ip6tables-save(5)}-style
format.  It prints output to stdout; suggested invocation therefore is

\verbatim{\
 # uruk-save > \statepath/iptables/active}

or

\verbatim{\
 # uruk-save -6 > \statepath/ip6tables/active}

.  This script is useful if you don't like the default behaviour of the uruk
init script, and would like it to load the current uruk rc file instead of the
current active file.  Please note: generally you don't need to invoke this
script manually: the init script which comes with uruk is suitable for most
cases, it invokes \uruk_save if needed.

\sec{warning}{WARNING}

Just as \uruk, in order to keep the \uruk_save script small and simple, the
script does very little error handling.  It does not check the contents of the
\rc file in any way before executing it.  When your \rc file contains bogus
stuff, \uruk_save will very likely behave in unexpected ways.  Caveat emptor.

\par

Things will likely break if you do fancy stuff in an \rc hook file.  For
instance, \uruk_save saves the filter table only.  If you define mangle or nat
tables, things will break.

\par

If your \rc file is in verbose mode (i.e. it features \tt{set -x}) or in no-act
mode (i.e. it features \tt{iptables='echo iptables'}), \uruk_save fails.
