# This script should be LSB 3.1.0 compliant.  In particular,
# http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/initscrcomconv.html
# and
# http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/iniscrptact.html
# should be adhered to:
# 
# Error and status messages should be printed with the logging functions (see
# Init Script Functions) log_success_msg(), log_failure_msg() and
# log_warning_msg(). Scripts may write to standard error or standard output, but
# implementations need not present text written to standard error/output to the
# user or do anything else with it.
# 
# LSB required:
# start   start the service
# stop    stop the service
# restart stop and restart the service if the service is already running,
#         otherwise start the service
# force-reload   cause the configuration to be reloaded if the service supports
#         this, otherwise restart the service if it is running
# status  print the current status of the service
# 
# In case of an error while processing any init-script action except for status,
# the init script shall print an error message and exit with a non-zero status
# code:
# 
# 1   generic or unspecified error (current practice)
# 2   invalid or excess argument(s)
# 3   unimplemented feature (for example, "reload")
# 4   user had insufficient privilege
# 5   program is not installed
# 6   program is not configured
# 7   program is not running
#
#
# Note that those situation shall also be regarded as success:
# * restarting a service (instead of reloading it)
#   with the "force-reload" argument
# * running "start" on a service already running
# * running "stop" on a service already stopped or not running
# * running "restart" on a service already stopped or not running
# * running "try-restart" on a service already stopped or not running
