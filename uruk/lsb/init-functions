# Modified by Joost van Baal-IliÄ‡ for uruk.

PATH=$PATH:/etc/redhat-lsb:/lib/uruk/lsb

# both Red Hat's and our implementation of lsb_start_daemon e.a.
# rely on file /etc/init.d/functions
if ! test -f /etc/init.d/functions ; then
  cat <<END
The file /etc/init.d/functions, as supplied by e.g. RPM
initscripts-9.03.31-2.el6.x86_64 is missing from your system.  Uruk should run
fine on any system conforming to the Linux Standard Base, as well as on any Red
Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora system.  If you'd like to run Uruk on
another system you're basically on your own.  Perhaps you can find a file
/lib/lsb/init-functions or /etc/init.d/functions somewhere, or perhaps you
could use uruk without using this init script.
