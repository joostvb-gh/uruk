INTRODUCTION

Uruk is a simple shell script (uruk(5)) which calls Linux
iptables.  It uses a template file to get lists of source addresses, allowed to
use specific network services.




REQUIREMENTS

Uruk is useful only on GNU/Linux systems.  However, the rc file (see
uruk-rc(5)) could be used by other packet filtering engine wrappers
too.

For this script to work, your Linux kernel needs stuff from the
netfilter/iptables project ( http://www.netfilter.org/ ).  The specific
needed settings are

 .config variable           module name   description in ``make config''

 CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES      ip_tables.o   (``IP tables support'')
 CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG    ipt_LOG.o     (``LOG target support'')
 CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE   ipt_state.o   (``Connection state match support'')
 CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT ipt_REJECT.o  (``REJECT target support'')

for CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE, you need

 CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK                   (``Connection tracking'')

.  Furthermore, you need the iptables(8) command, as shipped with the iptables
package from the netfilter project.


For typesetting the documentation (the uruk(8) and uruk-rc(5) manpages), you'll
need zoem.  Zoem is a an interpretive macro language, for creating mark-up
languages, by Stijn van Dongen.  Information about zoem, as well as tarballs
for download, can be found on the zoem webpage at http://micans.org/zoem/ .
Binary zoem packages for Debian GNU/Linux are available via ``deb
http://mdcc.cx/debian local contrib''.  Pretypesetted uruk docs are not
shipped, since their contents depend on your ./configure settings.


INSTALL

See the INSTALL file for generic installation instructions.  The Uruk init
script, in init/uruk, gets installed in /usr/local/etc/init.d/ by default.
Symlinks are _not_ created.  You'll have to create them yourself, after running
'make install'.  E.g. do:

 root@nagy:/etc/init.d# ln -s /usr/local/etc/init.d/uruk
 root@nagy:~# update-rc.d uruk defaults

.

(If you lack update-rc.d, do something like

 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc0.d/K92uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc1.d/K92uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc2.d/S20uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc3.d/S20uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc4.d/S20uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc5.d/S08uruk
 root@kubl01:/etc# ln -s ../init.d/uruk rc6.d/K92uruk

)


UPGRADE

After uruk version 20031026, the hooks are no longer called rc_1, rc_2, ....
rc_10, but rc_a, ... rc_i.  rc_1 is taken over by rc_a; rc_9 and rc_10 are
taken over by rc_i.  For most situations, replacing ``-A block'' with ``-A
INPUT'' suffices to translate rc_<n> to rc_<a>.  However, please take a look at
the uruk script itself to find out.  uruk-rc(5) is updated and contains some
examples.

See also the NEWS file.


POST INSTALLATION STUFF

See the ``GETTING STARTED'' section in the uruk(8) manpage for
hints.


MORE INFORMATION, SIMILAR TOOLS

The uruk(8) and uruk-rc(5) manpages are available in HTML
format too.  By default, they're installed in
/usr/local/share/doc/uruk/html/ .

The Uruk webpage is at http://mdcc.cx/uruk/ .

See also http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#6.2 and pf.conf(5) (online on
http://resin.csoft.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=5&topic=pf.conf ) for general
ideas on packet filtering.

A tool doing similar stuff as this script is Auke Kok's ``ferm'', available
from http://www.geo.vu.nl/~koka/ferm/ .  Other tools, with varying levels of
userfriendlyness (or bloatedness) are: ipmasq, shorewall, firestarter, ipmenu,
fireflier, firewall-easy, fwbuilder, fwctl, gfcc, lokkit, gnome-lokkit,
gshield, guarddog, hlfl, knetfilter, mason and gshield.  Another list of
alternatives is in the "Securing Debian Manual",
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch-sec-services.en.html#s-firewall-pack
; this howto is also available via the Debian harden-doc package.


TRIVIA

Uruk is named after the city of Uruk in Mesopotamia (now Iraq), that Gilgamesh
ruled in the Epic of Gilgamesh.  This epic reads something like:

 View its strong walls, for which there is no equal.

(I only have access to a Dutch translation here, which reads:

 De muren van Oeroek, het Oeroek van de schaapskooien, liet hij bouwen.
 ...
 Bekijk zijn overgelijkelijke borstwering.
 ...
 Bestijg de muren van Oeroek, loop erop.
 Beproef de fundering, bekijk het tichelwerk.
 Is zijn tichelwerk niet van baksteen?

.)

The city of Uruk is known under the name Erech in the bible:

  9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as
 Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
  10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and
 Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
                                         Gen10:9-10, KJV

It has nothing to do with http://www.uruk.org/ , where Erich Boleyn's Home Page
is.
