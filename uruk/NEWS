Uruk NEWS - user visible changes (and some other changes also.)

Refer to ChangeLog for detailed per-file info.

uruk version ......

- More examples in uruk-rc(5) manpage.  Thanks Roland van Hout for
  suggestion.

uruk version 20050718

- This is a pre-release.
- Added support for loglevel, see uruk-rc(5).  Some people were annoyed
  by uruk's syslog spamming.  If you're one of these, set loglevel=30 (or
  10) in your rc-file.


uruk version 20050414

- This is a pre-release.
- Uruk now is maintained using GNU Arch on http://arch.gna.org/uruk/ .
  See README.
- ChangeLog entries from 2003 split off in ChangeLog.2003.
- Uruk(8) now honors environment variables URUK_IPTABLES (/sbin/iptables by
  default) and URUK_CONFIG (/etc/uruk/rc by default).
- Now ships new script uruk-save(8); which saves /etc/uruk/rc in
  iptables-{save,restore} format, without invoking iptables.  You could
  use it e.g. when loading a new rc file.  See the updated uruk(8) manpage.
- The uruk init script now honors /etc/default/uruk.  See comments in the
  code.
- The uruk init script acts more sane when passed {stop,start} while no
  saved rules files are present: it tries to generate these in such
  circumstances.  It will warn you it's doing so.


uruk version 20040625

- Fixed bug in multiple IP per network interface mode.  Uruk was
  unusable in such a setup.
- Some tweaking of build system.


uruk version 20040216

- Fixed severe bugs in uruk script: 20040213 was unusable.
- init script now supports chkconfig: Red Hat is now better supported.


uruk version 20040213

- Support for multiple IP adresses on one network interface added.  New
  variables ips_<nic> and bcasts_<nic> introduced.  See uruk-rc(5).  Don't
  worry: your old rc file will still behave as it used to.


uruk version 20040210

- Allow more ICMP types by default.  Tnx Wessel Dankers for suggestion.
- The Uruk init script is now more helpful when often-encountered errors occur.
- Added warning to uruk(8) manpage: uruk does no sanity checking.


uruk version 20031111

- We no longer create our own ``block'' chain: the built-in INPUT and OUTPUT
  chains suffice for our purposes.  This makes uruk's rule setup much more
  simple.  Thanks to Wessel Dankers.
- rc_1, ... , rc_10 are NO LONGER SUPPORTED.  We use rc_a, rc_b, rc_c, ... now.
  In the future, rc_aa, rc_aab, ... might get added.  You'll HAVE TO rewrite
  your rc_<n> style stuff MANUALLY.  See the notes on UPGRADE in the README
  file.  (Your uruk/rc file will still work fine.  No other changes in the
  configuration file syntax are introduced in this release.)
- If you have saved your rules using iptables-save or the uruk init script,
  you'll have to rebuild them.  The old-style rules are not supported by this
  uruk release.


uruk version 20031026

- Fixed bug which made "/etc/init.d/uruk stop" to fail.
- Documented more of uruk's features.


uruk version 20031008

- Init script more robust, especially on fresh installs. (We still suffer
  from at least one bug though, see TODO.)
- Started documenting rc_<n> hooks.
- Various minor and cosmetic cleanups in documentation.


uruk version 20031004

- ad1810-firewall is now called uruk.
- big changes in build system and documentation system:
  - manpages have been converted from Perl's pod format to zoem format.  See
    README for details.
  - now build-depends on zoem: documentation depends on configure-time
    settings.
- ad1810-firewall under some circumstances was not reboot-resistent: I've
  missed a change in the Debian iptables package behaviour.
  The Debian iptables package >= 1.2.7-8 (7 Dec 2002) will not call
  /etc/init.d/iptables on boot by default.  We now ship our own
  init script to deal with this (thanks to Laurence J. Lane).


ad1810-firewall version 20030829

- ad1810-firewall-rc manpage converted from pod to zoem
  ( http://micans.org/zoem ).
- rc_1, rc_2, .... rc_10 feature supported by ad1810-firewall script: set
  e.g. rc_1=/usr/local/etc/ad1810-firewall/rc_1 in your
  ad1810-firewall-rc(5).  This file should contain shell code.  This is
  executed early in the ad1810-firewall routine, allowing finegrained tweaking
  of rules, for systems with special demands.  For now, see the
  ad1810-firewall shell code for more details.  More documentation will follow.


ad1810-firewall version 20030512

- Moving manpage format from pod to zoem.
- Fixed automatic version numbering in build system; no more wacky vyyyymmdd
  versions.  Thanks Raja R Harinath on the autoconf list.
- rc should no longer define e.g. sources_eth0_tcp_www, where www is a port,
  but e.g. sources_eth0_tcp_public, where public is a symbolic name for a
  (set of) services.  Furthermore, the new variable ports_eth0_tcp_public
  should be defined as e.g. "www".


ad1810-firewall version v20030427

- rc File location now depends on sysconfdir, as set during configure.
- Various documentation updates.


ad1810-firewall version v20030426

- First public alpha release.  Untested!
