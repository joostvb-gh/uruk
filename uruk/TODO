Fix bugs in uruk script.  See comments.

Add support for variable uruk_version : version of uruk when rc file was
created.

Now that a zoem > October 8, 2003 is released, start using the man::cat
macro.  See include.zmm.in.

Check documentation: uruk-rc manpage needs more stuff.

Write a wrapper for OpenBSD's pf and FreeBSD's ipfilter, so that these tools
can use the same rc file format.
