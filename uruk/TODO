Use the "build" init option: add to installation notes.  Check installation
notes.

Do extensive testing!

Finish NEWS: version.

Fix doc/rc version variable.

Fix bugs in uruk script: (force-)reload should do something sane when
uruk not running.

Check documentation: uruk-rc manpage needs more stuff.

Perhaps we need an uruk-init manpage, for the init script.

Write a wrapper for OpenBSD's pf and FreeBSD's ipfilter, so that these tools
can use the same rc file format.

Reimplement uruk-save: make it more robust.  See
http://www.faqs.org/docs/iptables/iptables-save.html for example of file
format.  Use logic from iptables-save.c.

Think about alternative for uruk-save: create a chain, and enable it once it's
fully build by doing just one iptables call.  This would allow truly atomical
loading of new rulesets.

Make uruk init-script LSB compliant.
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/initscrcomconv.html
Supply arguments like "status" in init script, see
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/iniscrptact.html

Is it sane to allow all traffic in default inactive rule?

Check save_counters support in init script.  It's likely broken.

Herken broadcasts (misschien aan destination MAC-adres?) en log ze niet.
.
alternative implementation: near code-snippet:
 # supporting this for multiple-ips would need multiple chains
 # or, perhaps, some iptables extension.
This log-spamming happens only in multiple-ip-per-nic mode.
Do DROP stuff just before log, would that work?  (No, we really can't do
something like "--dest !(ip1 or ip2 or ip3)".)
.
yet to implement: loglevel "high".  Document multiple ip per nic logspamming bug.

Finish IPv6 support.  Change to enabled-by-default.  Document it.

Phase out support for services_eth0_udp, but enforce ipS_eth0; warn for
obsolete syntax
