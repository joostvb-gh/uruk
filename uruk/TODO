Fix bugs in uruk script.  See comments.

Reimplement bootstrap as something like
   AUTOMAKE=automake-1.9 ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.9 autoreconf --install \
      --symlink --make

Add support for variable uruk_version : version of uruk when rc file was
created.

Check documentation: uruk-rc manpage needs more stuff.

Write a wrapper for OpenBSD's pf and FreeBSD's ipfilter, so that these tools
can use the same rc file format.

Reimplement uruk-save: make it more robust.  See
http://www.faqs.org/docs/iptables/iptables-save.html for example of file
format.  Use logic from iptables-save.c.

Add yet another warning about uruk-save: it'll fail if rc is in verbose or
debug mode.

Herken broadcasts (misschien aan destination MAC-adres?) en log ze niet.
.
alternative implementation: near code-snippet:
 # supporting this for multiple-ips would need multiple chains
 # or, perhaps, some iptables extension.
This log-spamming happens only in multiple-ip-per-nic mode.
Do DROP stuff just before log, would that work?  (No, we really can't do
something like "--dest !(ip1 or ip2 or ip3)".)
.
yet to implement: loglevel "high".  Document multiple ip per nic logspamming bug.

Add IPv6 support: sources6_<if>_....

Uruk init script should not only inspect /etc/default/uruk, but also
/etc/sysconfig/uruk (Red Hat / Fedora style)

Ship example /etc/default/uruk with this package, move out of Debian package.

force-reload in init script could do the uruk-save trick.
